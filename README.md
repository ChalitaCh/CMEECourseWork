## Week 1

Introduction to the UNIX and Linux, shell scripting and LaTeX. Code folder contains the shell utility scripts, where the data contains the example data files.

## Week2

Introduction to the basic Python syntax and data structure. How to write and run Python script, together with the control flow tools and debugging the Python script.
 
## Week 3

Introduction to the R, statistical software. This week, we explored the basic R syntax, Priciples of data wrangling and exploration. Generate publication quality figures, Data visualisation as well as how to find and fix errors in R code using debugging.

## Week 4

This week, Statistic in R was introduced to better understand its implication in ecology, evolution and conservation. To apply and interpret the results of parametic tests, t-test, correlations, and linear models

## Week 5

Spatial Analyses and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Introduction of GIS data types, handling GIS data, creating maps, data analyses and hypotheses testing in the spatial domain. In addition, the species distribution model and assessing model performance.

## Week 6

Genomic and Bioinformatics. Introduction to population genomic data, and the theory and computational methologies in inference of past population expansions and contrations from genomic data. The effect of migrations towards genomic variation and natural selection.


## Week 7

This week, we will look at how Python programming can be used in numerical computing, using numpu and scipy packages. The workflow for more reproducible and automated data analyses across R and Python using subprocess module, followed by the introduction into Jupyter notebook.

## MiniProject
