# 1)	Run the code you find under “examples” in the help file for lm
# 2)	Look through the helpfile for runif and see if you understand it.
# 3)	Increase and decrease the size of the random noise you add to the data, 
#     and see what it does to your linear model estimates! This will help you 
#     better understand the concepts behind it, and also help you to better 
#     interpret results. Further, I hope this will help you to use this tool 
#     (making up data where you know what the result should be like, and then 
#     analysing it) to better understand statistics. 
# 4)	Run the example code from the helpfile for runif and see if you can 
#     understand it.
