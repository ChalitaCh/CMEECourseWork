	abstract = {The growth of microorganisms involves the conversion of nutrients in the environment into biomass, mostly proteins and other macromolecules. This conversion is accomplished by networks of biochemical reactions cutting across cellular functions, such as metabolism, gene expression, transport and signalling. Mathematical modelling is a powerful tool for gaining an understanding of the functioning of this large and complex system and the role played by individual constituents and mechanisms. This requires models of microbial growth that provide an integrated view of the reaction networks and bridge the scale from individual reactions to the growth of a population. In this review, we derive a general framework for the kinetic modelling of microbial growth from basic hypotheses about the underlying reaction systems. Moreover, we show that several families of approximate models presented in the literature, notably flux balance models and coarse-grained whole-cell models, can be derived with the help of additional simplifying hypotheses. This perspective clearly brings out how apparently quite different modelling approaches are related on a deeper level, and suggests directions for further research.},

	abstract = {The life histories of microbial populations, under favorable and adverse conditions, exhibit a variety of growth, decay, and fluctuation patterns. They have been described by numerous mathematical models that varies considerably in structure and number of constants. The continuous logistic equation alone and combined with itself or with its mirror image, the Fermi function, can produce many of the observed growth patterns. They include those that are traditionally described by the Gompertz equation and peaked curves, with the peak being symmetric or asymmetric narrow or wide. The shape of survival and dose response curves appears to be determined by the distribution of the resistance's to the lethal agent among the individual organisms. Thus, exponential decay and Fermian or Gompertz-type curves can be considered manifestations of skewed to the right, symmetric, and skewed to the left distributions, respectively. Because of the mathematical constraints and determinism, the original discrete logistic equation can rarely be an adequate model of real microbial populations. However, by making its proportionality constant a normal-random variate it can simulate realistic histories of fluctuating microbial populations, including scenarios of aperiodic population explosions of varying intensities of the kind found in food-poisoning episodes.},

All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation.

	abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the "maximum specific growth rate" on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the "maximum specific growth rate." Different methods to determine the "lag time" often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or aw, need not be "multiplicative" and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being "mechanistic" are perfectly suitable for this purpose.},

	abstract = {Are enteric bacteria specifically adapted to the thermal environment of their hosts? In particular, do the optimal temperatures and thermal niches of the bacterial flora reflect seasonal, geographic, or phylogenetic differences in their hosts' temperatures? We examined these questions by measuring the relationship between the temperature-dependent growth rates of enteric bacteria in a free-living ectothermic host. We sampled two species of enteric bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) from three natural populations of slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) seasonally over two years. Despite pronounced differences in turtle body temperatures at different seasons and in different locations, we found no evidence that the thermal growth profiles of these bacteria mirrored this variation. Optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates in rich medium were nearly the same for both bacterial species (35–36°C, 2.5 doublings per hour). The thermal niche (defined as the range of temperatures over which 75\% of maximal growth rate occurred) was slightly higher for E. coli (28.5–41.0°C) than for S. enterica (27.7–39.8°C), but the niche breadth was about the same for both. We also measured the thermal dependence of growth rate in these same bacterial species isolated from mammalian hosts. Both bacterial species had temperatures of maximal growth and thermal niches that were about 2°C higher than those of their respective conspecifics sampled from turtles; niche breadths were not different. These data suggest that these bacterial species are thermal generalists that do not track fine-scale changes in their thermal environments. Even major differences in body temperatures, as great as those between ectothermic and endothermic hosts, may result in the evolution of rather modest changes in thermal properties.},

	abstract = {Human gut microbiota development has been associated with healthy growth but understanding the determinants of community assembly and composition is a formidable challenge. We cultured bacteria from serially collected fecal samples from a healthy infant; 34 sequenced strains containing 103,102 genes were divided into two consortia representing earlier and later stages in community assembly during the first six postnatal months. The two consortia were introduced alone (singly), or sequentially in different order, or simultaneously into young germ-free mice fed human infant formula. The pattern of fitness of bacterial strains observed across the different colonization conditions indicated that later-phase strains substantially outcompete earlier-phase strains, although four early-phase members persist. Persistence was not determined by order of introduction, suggesting that priority effects are not prominent in this model. To characterize succession in the context of the metabolic potential of consortium members, we performed in silico reconstructions of metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate utilization and amino acid and B-vitamin biosynthesis, then quantified the fitness (abundance) of strains in serially collected fecal samples and their transcriptional responses to different histories of colonization. Applying feature-reduction methods disclosed a set of metabolic pathways whose presence and/or expression correlates with strain fitness and that enable early-stage colonizers to survive during introduction of later colonizers. The approach described can be used to test the magnitude of the contribution of identified metabolic pathways to fitness in different community contexts, study various ecological processes thought to govern community assembly, and facilitate development of microbiota-directed therapeutics.},

However, food spoilage has resulted in food insecurity in different regions of the world. Spoilage of food occurs when the quality of food deteriorates from its original organoleptic properties observed at the time of processing. Food spoilage results in huge economic losses to both producers (farmers) and consumers. Factors such as storage temperature, pH, water availability, presence of spoilage microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, initial microbial load (total viable count—TVC), and processing influence the rate of food spoilage. This article reviews the spoilage microbiota and spoilage mechanisms in meat and dairy products and seafood. Understanding food spoilage mechanisms will assist in the development of robust technologies for the prevention of food spoilage and waste.},

Growth rates were obtained in laboratory medium by using a binary dilutions method in which 15 optical density curves were generated to determine one μ value. The temperature was in the range from 2 to 48 °C, depending on the bacterial species. Data were analysed after a square root transformation. No large difference between the strains of a same species was observed, and therefore all the strains of a same species were analysed together with the same secondary model. The variability of the residual error, including both measurements errors and biological strain difference, was homogenous for sub-optimal temperature values. To represent this variability in bacterial kinetic simulation, the 95\% confidence interval based on an asymptotic Normal distribution, around the growth rate value was determined. With this modelling approach, the behaviour of bacterial species on food, irrespective of the strain or the laboratory, was described. This growth simulation with confidence limits has several applications, such as to facilitate comparisons between a challenge-test and simulation results, and, to appreciate if the temperature change has or has not a significant effect on a bacterial growth profile, with regard to the uncontrolled factors. The integration of this piece of work in the Sym'Previus software is now in process. Results obtained in five French laboratories will be extended by working on new food and new microbial species and improved by further work on variability estimation.},

The developed λ model was subsequently combined with a logistic differential equation to simulate bacterial numbers over time. To develop a novel model for λ, we determined whether bacterial growth had begun, i.e., whether λ had ended, at each time point during the growth kinetics. The growth of B. cereus was evaluated by optical density (OD) measurements in culture media for various pHs (5.5 ∼ 7.0) and salt concentrations (0.5 ∼ 2.0\%) at static temperatures (10 ∼ 20°C). The probability of the end of λ was modeled using dichotomous judgments obtained at each OD measurement point concerning whether a significant increase had been observed. The probability of the end of λ was described as a function of time, temperature, pH, and salt concentration and showed a high goodness of fit. The λ model was validated with independent data sets of B. cereus growth in culture media and foods, indicating acceptable performance. Furthermore, the λ model, in combination with a logistic differential equation, enabled a simulation of the population of B. cereus in various foods over time at static and/or fluctuating temperatures with high accuracy. Thus, this newly developed modeling procedure enables the description of λ using observable environmental parameters without any conceptual assumptions and the simulation of bacterial numbers over time with the use of a logistic differential equation.},

In the current study, primary, secondary, and tertiary models for growth of Salmonella Typhimurium (10(4.8) CFU/g) on sterile chicken were developed and validated. Kinetic data obtained at 10 to 40 degrees C were fit to a primary model to determine initial density (N0), lag time (lambda), maximum specific growth rate (micromax), and maximum population density (Nmax). Secondary models for N0, lambda, micromax, and Nmax as a function of temperature were developed and combined with the primary model to create a tertiary model that predicted pathogen density (N) at times and temperatures used and not used in model development. Performance of models was evaluated using the acceptable prediction zone method in which experimental error associated with growth parameter determinations was used to set criteria for acceptable model performance. Models were evaluated against dependent and independent (validation) data. Models with 70\% prediction or relative errors (RE) in an acceptable prediction zone from -0.3 to 0.15 for micromax, -0.6 to 0.3 for lambda, and -0.8 to 0.4 for N, N0, and Nmax were classified as acceptable. All secondary models had acceptable goodness of fit and were validated against independent (interpolation) data. Percent RE in the acceptable prediction zone for the tertiary model was 90.7 for dependent data and 97.5 for independent (interpolation) data. Although the tertiary model was validated for interpolation, an unacceptable \%RE of 2.5 was obtained for independent (extrapolation) data obtained with a lower N0 (10(0.8) CFU/g). The tertiary model provided overly fail-dangerous predictions of N from a lower N0. Because Salmonella concentrations on chicken are closer to 10(0.8) than 10(4.8) CFU/g, the tertiary model should not be used to help assess chicken safety.},

	abstract = {The Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) is a popular method for comparing the adequacy of multiple, possibly nonnested models. Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the “raw” AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

	abstract = {Despite internal complexity, tumor growth kinetics follow relatively simple laws that can be expressed as mathematical models. To explore this further, quantitative analysis of the most classical of these were performed. The models were assessed against data from two in vivo experimental systems: an ectopic syngeneic tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma) and an orthotopically xenografted human breast carcinoma. The goals were threefold: 1) to determine a statistical model for description of the measurement error, 2) to establish the descriptive power of each model, using several goodness-of-fit metrics and a study of parametric identifiability, and 3) to assess the models' ability to forecast future tumor growth. The models included in the study comprised the exponential, exponential-linear, power law, Gompertz, logistic, generalized logistic, von Bertalanffy and a model with dynamic carrying capacity. For the breast data, the dynamics were best captured by the Gompertz and exponential-linear models. The latter also exhibited the highest predictive power, with excellent prediction scores (≥80\%) extending out as far as 12 days in the future. For the lung data, the Gompertz and power law models provided the most parsimonious and parametrically identifiable description. However, not one of the models was able to achieve a substantial prediction rate (≥70\%) beyond the next day data point. In this context, adjunction of a priori information on the parameter distribution led to considerable improvement. For instance, forecast success rates went from 14.9\% to 62.7\% when using the power law model to predict the full future tumor growth curves, using just three data points. These results not only have important implications for biological theories of tumor growth and the use of mathematical modeling in preclinical anti-cancer drug investigations, but also may assist in defining how mathematical models could serve as potential prognostic tools in the clinic.},

	abstract = {The evolution of resistance to antibiotics is a major public health problem and an example of rapid adaptation under natural selection by antibiotics. The dynamics of antibiotic resistance within and between hosts can be understood in the light of mathematical models that describe the epidemiology and evolution of the bacterial population. “Between‐host” models describe the spread of resistance in the host community, and in more specific settings such as hospitalized hosts (treated by antibiotics at a high rate), or farm animals. These models make predictions on the best strategies to limit the spread of resistance, such as reducing transmission or adapting the prescription of several antibiotics. Models can be fitted to epidemiological data in the context of intensive care units or hospitals to predict the impact of interventions on resistance. It has proven harder to explain the dynamics of resistance in the community at large, in particular because models often do not reproduce the observed coexistence of drug‐sensitive and drug‐resistant strains. “Within‐host” models describe the evolution of resistance within the treated host. They show that the risk of resistance emergence is maximal at an intermediate antibiotic dose, and some models successfully explain experimental data. New models that include the complex host population structure, the interaction between resistance‐determining loci and other loci, or integrating the within‐ and between‐host levels will allow better interpretation of epidemiological and genomic data from common pathogens and better prediction of the evolution of resistance.},

	abstract = {The differential warming of land and ocean leads to many continental regions in the Northern Hemisphere warming at rates higher than the global mean temperature. Adaptation and conservation efforts will, therefore, benefit from understanding regional consequences of limiting the global mean temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, a limit agreed upon at the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris in December 2015. Here, we analyze climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to determine the timing and magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes across the contiguous United States (US) for global warming of 1.5 and 2°C and highlight consensus and uncertainties in model projections and their implications for making decisions. The regional warming rates differ considerably across the contiguous US, but all regions are projected to reach 2°C about 10-20 years before the global mean temperature. Although there is uncertainty in the timing of exactly when the 1.5 and 2°C thresholds will be crossed regionally, over 80\% of the models project at least 2°C warming by 2050 for all regions for the high emissions scenario. This threshold-based approach also highlights regional variations in the rate of warming across the US. The fastest warming region in the contiguous US is the Northeast, which is projected to warm by 3°C when global warming reaches 2°C. The signal-to-noise ratio calculations indicate that the regional warming estimates remain outside the envelope of uncertainty throughout the twenty-first century, making them potentially useful to planners. The regional precipitation projections for global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C are uncertain, but the eastern US is projected to experience wetter winters and the Great Plains and the Northwest US are projected to experience drier summers in the future. The impact of different scenarios on regional precipitation projections is negligible throughout the twenty-first century compared to uncertainties associated with internal variability and model diversity.},

	abstract = {The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is a canonical component of animal and plant immune systems. In plants, intracellular pathogen sensing by immune receptors triggers their TIR domains to generate a molecule which is a variant of cyclic ADP-ribose (v-cADPR). This molecule is hypothesized to activate plant cell death via a yet unresolved pathway. TIR domains were recently also shown to be involved in a bacterial anti-phage defense system called Thoeris, but the mechanism of Thoeris defense remained unknown. In this study we report that phage infection triggers Thoeris TIR-domain proteins to produce an isomer of cyclic ADP-ribose. This molecular signal activates a second protein, ThsA, which then depletes the cell of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and leads to abortive infection and cell death. We further show that similar to eukaryotic innate immune systems, bacterial TIR-domain proteins determine the immunological specificity to the invading pathogen. Our results describe a new antiviral signaling pathway in bacteria, and suggest that generation of intracellular signaling molecules is an ancient immunological function of TIR domains conserved in both plant and bacterial immunity.},

	abstract = {better understanding of co-evolution between pathogens and hosts holds promise for better prevention and control strategies. This review will explore the interactions between Burkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental and opportunistic pathogen, and the human host immune system. B. pseudomallei causes “Melioidosis”, a rapidly fatal tropical infectious disease predicted to affect 165,000 cases annually worldwide, of which 89,000 are fatal. Genetic heterogeneities were reported in both B. pseudomallei and human host population, some of which may, at least in part, contribute to inter-individual differences in disease susceptibility. Here, we review (i) a multi-host - pathogen characteristic of the interaction; (ii) selection pressures acting on B. pseudomallei and human genomes with the former being driven by bacterial adaptation across ranges of ecological niches while the latter are driven by human encounter of broad ranges of pathogens; (iii) the mechanisms that generate genetic diversity in bacterial and host population particularly in sequence encoding proteins functioning in host - pathogen interaction; (iv) reported genetic and structural variations of proteins or molecules observed in B. pseudomallei – human host interactions and their implications in infection outcomes. Together, these predict bacterial and host evolutionary trajectory which continues to generate genetic diversity in bacterium and operates host immune selection at the molecular level.},
